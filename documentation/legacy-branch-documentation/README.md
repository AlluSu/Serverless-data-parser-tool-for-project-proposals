# Legacy branch

As of Sprint 4 onwards, we as a team started to develop Parsa to Serverless architecture. All features done after sprint 4 (sprint 5 and sprint 6) where implemented to the Serverless version of Parsa. The old Node.js version of Parsa can found from branch called **legacy-25-3-2022** if somebody some day wishes to develop it more. This legacy backend version is missing some features which are on the Serverless version.
